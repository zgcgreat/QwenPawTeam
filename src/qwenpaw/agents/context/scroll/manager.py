"""ScrollContextManager — write-through + eviction-index context management.

The strategy form of the design in ``CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.html``: instead of
subclassing the agent, it is injected into :class:`QwenPawAgent` and drives the
two delegated hooks.

* :meth:`on_save` — every live turn is persisted to the durable
  ``conversation_history`` as it enters the window (write-through).
* :meth:`compress` — past the token threshold, keep a pinned head + recent tail
  and fold the evicted middle into an in-context :class:`EvictionIndex`. No
  summarization, nothing lost — every node points to a ``seq`` span recallable
  via the sandboxed ``recall_history_python`` REPL.
